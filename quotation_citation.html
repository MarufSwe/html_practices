	<blockquote>I have loved writing since class 8-9, though that was not a specific topic, but I like to write about the events around me. I used to write on blogspot while I was in university, but now writing on my own blog. writing is my hobby and I love it, and itâ€™s not my profession.  My blog posts are completely an expression of my mind so I may not always be right.</blockquote>
